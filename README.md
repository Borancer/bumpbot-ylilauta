You need python3 or higher to use this.

Also you need selenium module (you can install it by sudo apt install python3-pip and then pip install selenium)

also you need to choose your own path for chromedriver (https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.34/)

Then just run program by python3 dumbbibotti.py

Also if someone wants to make version for windows feel free to do
